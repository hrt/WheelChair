# Outdated


### What is this?
A repository with code used to bypass java-script based anti cheats as well as staying undetected by them. See https://github.com/hrt/TamperDetectJS for more reading.

Nothing is obfuscated. The idea was that krunker.io's anti cheat team would improve their solutions using similar concepts introduced in this repository, which they did.

The name "wheelchair" comes from the code "crippling" all the window instances made by the webpage.
