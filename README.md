Uninstall and reinstall the chrome extension. There has been an update.


# ♿ 1.9.0 wheelchair
Become a cripple, use a wheelchair...

### Chromium Extension
Remove all exisiting scripts.

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode (probably a checkbox in the top right)
3. [Download this unpacked extension (click here)](https://github.com/hrt/wheelchair/releases/download/2.0/loader.zip)
4. Drag the downloaded zip into the extensions page

If you can figure out reliable ways to identify the presence of the extension running then I am interested to know how.

### Tampermonkey (deprecated)
Alternatively you can install and use [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) . This method is not suggested since it is easy to detect.

1. Create new script
2. Copy and paste the script from [here (click)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hrt/wheelchair/master/wheelchair.js)
3. Save the script
